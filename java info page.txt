â€¢ These issues are impacting the overall efficiency, transparency, and responsiveness of the system, potentially putting lives at risk. Some key problems include:
r Rates
Security and Privacy Concerns: Manual record keeping raises concerns about data security and privacy breaches, as sensitive donor and recipient information is vulnerable to unauthorized access.
Emergency Response Delays: During emergencies, the lack of a streamlined system for quick coordination between blood banks and hospitals results in delays in providing timely blood units to patients in critical need.
Lack of Education: Many individuals lack proper education about blood donation, including its benefits, the donation process, and the impact it has on saving lives. This lack of knowledge contributes to misconceptions and hesitation among potential donors.");
